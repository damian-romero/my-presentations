## Part 2

# Planning graduate school with Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

---

# Monitoring and evaluation (M&E)

Program monitoring and evaluation is a systematic discipline focused on assessing the design, implementation, and outcomes of programs to improve effectiveness, ensure accountability, and inform decision-making.

---

# Is M&E a real thing?

M&E courses are taught in universities in many programs including:

---

# How come I have never heard of it?

M&E is often used in policy planning and implementation and government programs.

---
 
# But wait...

What does program manatement have to do with my graduate experience?

I am surely not going to manage my own graduate program.

---

# Treat your academic objectives as a program

In this context, a program is a structured set of activities and interventions designed to achieve specific goals and outcomes, often within a defined timeframe and targeted towards addressing particular issues or needs within a community, organization, or sector.

# The Theory of Change and the Logic Models

# Useful vocabulary

# Theory of Change

A Theory of Change is a comprehensive framework that outlines the process of achieving a long-term goal by identifying the necessary preconditions, interventions, and causal linkages.

---

# Examples

1.

2.

3.

Make emphasis on the goals.

---

# Sharing our objectives

The first step is to share our objectives.

Typically, if you are in a course-based program, your objectives would align with acquiring certain skills to do something. Tell us what that something is.

In a research-based program you usually acquire and generate new knowledge to achieve some goal. What is that goal?

---

Let's take five minutes to write down our goals, then we'll share them outloud.

---

Work on the rest of the Theory of Change

---

# The Logic Model

---

# What is a Logic Model?

A Logic Model is a visual representation that maps out the resources, activities, outputs, and outcomes of a program to illustrate the logical sequence and connections between these components in achieving the program's goals.

---

Useful vocabulary

---

# Share resources, activities. outputs and outcomes

---

Putting it all down on paper

---

# Next time

We will focus on program monitoring and evaluation (M&E) strategies. Specifically, we'll:

- Discuss how to effectively plan your graduate journey.
- Share and set our objectives.
- Create a personalized **Theory of Change** and **Logic Model**.
