# GitHub + Obsidian

## I. The Git/GitHub part

1) Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2) Create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)
3) Copy and paste that Personal Access Token. Save it. Do not share it.

---

### To finish with this part let's create a text we'll use later:

* https://PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git

For example, mine will be this:

* https://PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/TypoMC/Gradschool-Notes.git

---

## II. The Obsidian part

1) Install the Git plugin
2) Copy to your clipboard that text we created in the last slide
3) Open the Command Palette
4) In the Command Palette type **Clone the existing remote repo**
5) Paste the text that was in your clipboard and press Enter
