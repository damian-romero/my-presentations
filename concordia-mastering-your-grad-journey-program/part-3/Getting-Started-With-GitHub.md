# A Comprehensive Guide to GitHub for Graduate Students in Education

## Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is a popular online platform that allows users to collaborate on projects, manage tasks, and keep track of progress. While it is commonly known for its use in software development, GitHub offers a variety of project management tools that can be useful for graduate students in education, even those who may not have a technical background. This guide will walk you through the basics of GitHub's project management features and the reasons why you would integrate GitHub with Obsidian to streamline your workflow.

## Getting Started with GitHub

### Creating a GitHub Account

1. **Sign Up for GitHub**:
   - Visit [GitHub's signup page](https://github.com/join).
   - Enter your email address, create a username, and choose a password.
   - Follow the prompts to complete the account setup.

### Creating a Repository on GitHub

1. **Create a New Repository**:

   - Check the box to initialize the repository with a `README` file.
   - Click `Create repository`.

### Creating a Secondary Account for GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a tool that allows you to automate tasks in your projects. For security reasons, it can be beneficial to create a secondary account to use with GitHub Actions.

1. **Sign Up for a Secondary Account**:
   - Follow the same steps as above to create a new GitHub account.
   - Use a different email address and username than your primary account.

2. **Add the Secondary Account to Your Repository**:
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
   - Go to `Settings` > `Collaborators and teams`.
   - Invite your secondary account to collaborate on the repository.

## GitHub Project Management Tools
### GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues is a tool for tracking tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects.

1. **Creating an Issue**:
   - Navigate to the `Issues` tab in your repository.
   - Click `New issue` and fill in the title and description.
   - Assign the issue to a milestone, label it, and assign it to a team member if applicable.
### GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects is a tool that allows you to organize and manage your tasks using customizable boards.

1. **Creating a Project Board**:
   - In your repository, go to the `Projects` tab.
   - Click `New Project` and choose a template or start from scratch.
   - Give your project a name and description, then click `Create project`.

2. **Adding Issues and Notes**:
   - Click `Add cards` to add issues (tasks) or notes (reminders).
   - Drag and drop cards to organize them within columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).

### Project Roadmaps

A project roadmap is a visual representation of your project's goals and milestones over time.

1. **Creating a Roadmap**:
   - Within your project board, create columns for different time frames (e.g., Q1, Q2).
   - Add issues or notes representing milestones and tasks for each time frame.
   - Use labels and due dates to keep track of priorities and deadlines.

### Kanban Boards

Kanban boards are a type of project management board that helps visualize your workflow.

1. **Setting Up a Kanban Board**:
   - When creating a new project, select the Kanban template.
   - Create columns such as `Backlog`, `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`.
   - Move cards between columns to reflect the current status of each task.

## Integrating GitHub with Obsidian

### Why Integrate GitHub with Obsidian?

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking app that can be integrated with GitHub to back up your work and manage your notes. Integrating these tools can provide several benefits:

- **Automatic Backups**: Regularly backup your notes to GitHub to prevent data loss.
- **Version History**: Keep track of changes to your notes over time.
- **Organization**: Use GitHub's project management tools to organize and link your notes.

We'll cover the detailed steps on how to integrate GitHub with Obsidian during our upcoming workshop. Stay tuned for more information!

## Summary

GitHub provides a suite of tools that can help you manage your projects efficiently, even if you have no technical background. By using GitHub Projects, project roadmaps, Kanban boards, and GitHub Issues, you can keep track of tasks and milestones. Additionally, integrating GitHub with Obsidian ensures that your work is backed up and organized. With these tools at your disposal, you can focus more on your research and less on managing your projects.
